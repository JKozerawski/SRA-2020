What you are seeing right now is a jupyter notebook. We will be using jupyter notebooks in all our labs. In this section, we will walk you through how to install jupyter notebook on CSIL so that the notebook is hosted remotely on CSIL and you can edit the notebook locally in your browser.\n","\n","Firstly, install jupyter notebook by typing the following command into your command line interface that is connected to CSIL.\n","```\n","pip3 install --user notebook\n","```\n","When it is done executing, type the following to open up jupyter notebook.\n","```\n","jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888\n","```\n","In this command, we specified which port the jupyter notebook should be hosted, that is, port 8888.

(If your local 8888 port is somehow taken already, you will see an error message and you should change the first number.) The second number is the number of the remote port on CSIL. (So if previously you hosted your notebook on a different port number, remember to change this number.) As before, replace ```cgaucho``` with your username. If you are using another CSIL hostname, remember to replace ```csil-12``` with whichever hostname you are using.\n","\n","Now let's open up your broswer window, and type\n","```\n","http://localhost:8888\n","```\n","into your address bar. (If in the previous step you used another local port, replace 8888 with your local port number.) If you are prompted to enter a token, find the token from your command line interface window that is connected to CSIL and copy-paste. After that you should be able to see the folder structure on CSIL in your local broswer.\n","\n","Now let's upload this jupyter notebook onto CSIL! There is a *Upload* button on the top right corner.
